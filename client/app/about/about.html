    The Vision and Mission of Heart & Hammer started much before a name or website was ever created.  We began as a family with the opportunity to make an impact in the communities we grew and developed from.  Both domestically and abroad, each of our families have been involved in donating our time, services, goods, or money to help those in need.  

    We are committed to doing what we can with the connections and resources we have and are excited to begin this journey with the HomeReach Foundation.  Home Reach is dedicated in providing medical care and socio-economic assistance particularly to the poor people in the Philippines.  Home Reach Foundation is focused on doing our major initiatives in order to accomplish its mission; Health, Education, Livelihood and Patrimony (HELP).

        <p>Tara Lerias is currently a Front End Developer for Priceline.com. She has been developing websites for a couple years which has lead her to build the Heart and Hammer website. The first Humanitarian Mission Tara has participated in was in 2007 in Bohol, Philippines where the most cultural shocking moment of her life was getting off the bus for the first time and seeing thirty or so kids playing on the side of the road with cans. They had no shoes, no clothes and homes made of old store front signs and palm leaves. She felt truly inspired to continue helping those in need through humanitarian efforts which has lead her to start Heart and Hammer.
