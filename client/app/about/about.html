  <div class="about-content">
    The Vision and Mission of Heart & Hammer started much before a name or website was ever created.  We began as a family with the opportunity to make a positive impact in the communities where we grew up.  Both domestically and abroad, our families have donated time, energy, goods, and money to help those in need.  

    We are committed to doing what we can with the connections and resources we have and are excited to begin this journey with the Home-Reach Foundation 501(c)(3).  Home-Reach is dedicated to providing medical care and socio-economic assistance particularly to the poor in the Philippines.  Home-Reach Foundation supports Heart & Hammer to accomplish its mission; Health, Education, Livelihood and Patrimony (HELP).

Tara was just 16 years old when she participated in her first humanitarian mission and traveled to Bohol, Philippines in 2007. “The most cultural shocking moment of my life was getting off the bus for the first time and seeing thirty or so kids playing on the side of the road with cans.They had no shoes, no clothes, and their homes were made of old store front signs and palm leaves.” From this experience, Tara has been inspired to continue helping those in need. Tara is a founding member of Heart and Hammer, and the website developer for the organization.
