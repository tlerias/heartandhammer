    <div class="mission-description">
<!--     <p>The town of Maria, in the island province of Siquijor, is a 5th class municipality with a population of 13,544. Most of the people depend on farming and fishing for their livelihood. Some families have members working as Overseas Filipino Workers and others have members engaged in small businesses, but life is still a struggle for most. While the municipal government strives to meet the basic needs of the people within its limited income, 800 families are still considered as indigent and live in poverty. They struggle from day to day to earn a few pesos to buy some kilos of rice, without thinking of viands to go with it. Heart and Hammer has teamed up with the government of Maria to distribute goods to these 800 families during this Humanitarian Mission.</p>

    <p>In Bohol, we are going to reach two <a href="http://www.gk1world.com" target="_new">Gawad Kalinga</a> (Helping Hands) Villages. This includes 80 families in Dawies and 20 families in Baclayon. Gawad Kalinga are villages built on land donations. The houses in the villages cost about $3,000.00 each to build. The families living in these homes were all previously living in squatter areas and are considered the poorest members of the city. Heart and Hammer will also be visiting these two villages to distribute goods to these impoverished families.</p>

    <p>A humanitarian mission by Heart and Hammer will go a long way to helping these indigent families. Even basic necessities, such as, clothes, shoes, blankets, towels, and personal hygiene kits are considered luxuries by these poor families. Kilos of rice, canned goods, and other food items will bring great joy to them. Heart and Hammer looks forward to meeting these people and bringing donated goods to help their unfortunate situation.</p> -->

      <p>In June of 2015, the Heart and Hammer team distributed almost 1000 care packages serving 4 different communities in 2 different Islands of the Philippines. The first stop was in Maria, Siquihor, where 800 families considered as indigent and live in poverty in 21 Barangays (municipalities) received care packages. Next, the team went to Bohol and served 3 different Gawad Kalinga (Helping Hands) Villages including Dawies 80 families served, Tagbilaran 39 families served, and Baclayon 20 families served. Each family received 10 lbs. of rice, 2 cans of sardines, 2 ramen noodles, toiletries, personal hygiene kits, clothing, candy, pasta, toys, school supplies, teas, coffees, etc. for which was sorted, assembled, and distributed. Colgate also donated and shipped 1000 toothbrushes & toothpastes directly to the Philippines and was included in each of the care packages distributed.</p>

        <h4>June 2015 Testimonial:</h4>
        <p class="testimonial">"I appreciate everyone that supported our Heart and Hammer mission trip to the Philippines. Every donation put forth towards the mission trip greatly affects the lives of hundreds of Filipinos. It was an amazing experience witnessing first-hand all of the lives that were changed for the better. I got to personally hand out care packages that couldn’t be possible without all of the support to families and children, young and old. The care packages do not just affect an individual, but an entire family. And the greatest gift of all is seeing their appreciation through their beautiful smiles. The slightest show of support goes a very long way towards changing lives for the better. To the world, you may be on person…but to one person, you may be the world." - T.J. DiCesare</p>
