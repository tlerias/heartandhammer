    <div class="mission-description">
    <p>The town of Maria, in the island province of Siquijor, is a 5th class municipality with a population of 13,544. Most of the people depend on farming and fishing for their livelihood. Some families have members working as Overseas Filipino Workers and others have members engaged in small businesses, but life is still a struggle for most. While the municipal government strives to meet the basic needs of the people within its limited income, 800 families are still considered as indigent and live in poverty. They struggle from day to day to earn a few pesos to buy some kilos of rice, without thinking of viands to go with it. Heart and Hammer has teamed up with the government of Maria to distribute goods to these 800 families during this Humanitarian Mission.</p>

    <p>In Bohol, we are going to reach two <a href="http://www.gk1world.com" target="_new">Gawad Kalinga</a> (Helping Hands) Villages. This includes 80 families in Dawies and 20 families in Baclayon. Gawad Kalinga are villages built on land donations. The houses in the villages cost about $3,000.00 each to build. The families living in these homes were all previously living in squatter areas and are considered the poorest members of the city. Heart and Hammer will also be visiting these two villages to distribute goods to these impoverished families.</p>

    <p>A humanitarian mission by Hammer and Heart will go a long way to helping these indigent families. Even basic necessities, such as, clothes, shoes, blankets, towels, and personal hygiene kits are considered luxuries by these poor families. Kilos of rice, canned goods, and other food items will bring great joy to them. Heart and Hammer looks forward to meeting these people and bringing donated goods to help their unfortunate situation.</p>
