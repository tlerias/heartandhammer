	    	quote: 'I appreciate everyone that supported our Heart and Hammer mission trip to the Philippines. Every donation put forth towards the mission trip greatly affects the lives of hundreds of Filipinos. It was an amazing experience witnessing first-hand all of the lives that were changed for the better. I got to personally hand out care packages that couldn’t be possible without all of the support to families and children, young and old. The care packages do not just affect an individual, but an entire family. And the greatest gift of all is seeing their appreciation through their beautiful smiles. The slightest show of support goes a very long way towards changing lives for the better. To the world, you may be on person…but to one person, you may be the world.',
